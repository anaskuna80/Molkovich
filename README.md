### What is Molkovich?

This project is a game in space shooter style created with Python and the library Pyglet.

The game is meant to be like the popular franchise "Gradius" but with much less features.

The purpose with this project is for learn to code a game using Pyglet as Python library.

It is also a way to get more knowledge about to code in OOP standard. 

The mission of the the game is intended to get a spaceship to the end of the for now only level and meet the bos “Molkovich”.

I you success with defeating “Molkovich”, the game ends.

At this moment a lot of things is left todo.

Read the TODOS.md for more info about the delelopment status.

Hopefully will this game be finished in the future and I also want to mention that this game is a tribute to the school that learned me a lot of my programming skills:
